# 🧱 dsnchz

Welcome to the **dsnchz** GitHub organization — a home for open source packages designed to expand and enrich the SolidJS ecosystem.

> 💡 All packages here are published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/org/dschz) under the [`@dschz`](https://www.npmjs.com/org/dschz) scope.

## ✨ Purpose

The goal of this organization is to provide high-quality, type-safe, and idiomatic SolidJS libraries by porting popular React libraries and UI utilities to Solid. We aim to:

- Bring familiar and proven patterns from the React ecosystem into SolidJS.
- Create first-class Solid wrappers for existing JavaScript libraries.
- Deliver performant, reactive components and utilities that feel native to Solid.

## 🔧 Philosophy

- **Minimal API surface**: Stay close to the original library where possible.
- **Idiomatic Solid**: Embrace fine-grained reactivity and Solid’s composition model.
- **Type Safety**: First-class TypeScript support is non-negotiable.
- **Developer Experience**: Great DX with good docs, examples, and clear patterns.
